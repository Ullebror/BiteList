# BiteList

This is a student project to create an expo mobile app that fetches recipes from Edamam API endpoint. Users can use the basics without logging in, but to add favourites and to keep an existing shopping list, registration is required. The users can search recipes with a keyword and click a recipe to see the ingredients for the recipe and a link to the recipe itself. From the full recipe the user can create a shopping list where they can also add their own items. As a logged in user, the user can add more than one recipes ingredients to a shopping list.
