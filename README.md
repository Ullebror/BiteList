# BiteList

This is a student project to create an expo mobile app that fetches recipes from a yet unspecified API endpoint. The users can search recipes with a keyword and click a recipe to see it fully. From the full recipe the user can create
a shopping list where they can also add their own items. Users can use the basics without logging in, but to add favourites, registration is required.
